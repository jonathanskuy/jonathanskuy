## Featured Projects 🌟
### Exploring the Relationship between Education Quality and Property Prices in Manchester
**Quantitative analysis of the relationship between school quality scores and property prices across Manchester.**

**Key Features**
- Integrated 1M+ UK property transaction data records with Ofsted school inspection scores and Index of Multiple 
Deprivation datasets to analyse their relationship using multiple linear regression 
- Discovered that both education quality and school presence in the area have marginal significance at p = 0.081 
and weakly affect property prices, but socioeconomic deprivation and distance to the city centre are statistically 
significant at p < 0.05 and strongly drives property prices 
- Produced 10+ spatial visualisations and regression diagnostics to visualise variations and support results and 
investment insights

### Aircraft Engine Predictive Maintenance
**AI-powered system focused on the prediction of aircraft engine maintenance points based on remaining useful life**

**Key Features**
- Developed a complete preprocessing pipeline from raw engine sensor data and engineered temporal features 
such as rolling statistics and trends to capture engine degradation 
- Compared the usage of XGBoost and Ridge regression the predictive model in terms of the accuracy of engine 
maintenance point prediction 
- Demonstrated that linear models (Ridge) are adequate for simple operating conditions (FD001) while XGBoost 
strongly outperforms it for complex operating conditions (FD004) 
- Achieved approximately 26% decrease in final-cycle MAE on FD004 using XGBoost compared to Ridge regression, 
significantly increasing the accuracy of the predictive model in estimating maintenance points of engines under 
complex operating conditions

**Repo:** TBD
